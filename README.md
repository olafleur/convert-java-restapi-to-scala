Convert Java API to Scala
========================
The aim of this project is to take a [basic REST API Example](https://github.com/resteasy/Resteasy/tree/master/jaxrs/examples/oreilly-workbook/ex03_1) and show that we can convert it to Scala easily.

Constraints :
- The domain object (Customer) must stay in Java
- The RestEasy test also
